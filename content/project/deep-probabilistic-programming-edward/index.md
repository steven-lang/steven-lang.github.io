Write-up and presentation during the Extended Machine Learning Seminar at TU Darmstadt about the Edward deep probabilistic programming language.

### Abstract 

Probabilistic programming is the approach to adopt probabilistic models and
inference as first class citizens of a programming language. Its main goal is
lowering the entry barrier into the field of probabilistic modeling and allow
easier and faster prototyping in research. 

In recent years, a new class of these languages has risen: Deep probabilistic
programming languages. Their focus is on unifying probabilistic programming
languages with the modeling power, efficiency and composability of deep neural
networks in the field of machine learning. We focus on Edward, a Turing-complete
deep probabilistic programming language, and compare it to prior, as well as
future work. Edward makes probabilistic programming as flexible and
computationally efficient as deep learning and allows for rich compositions of
probabilistic models and inference procedures.
