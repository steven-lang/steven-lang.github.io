This led me to a setup in which I store all research papers in some directory structure at ~/papers/ and have this directory be in sync with a synchronization service; currently OneDrive, which has an excellent third-party Linux client.\nMany of the papers I find are hosted on arXiv.org. When I\u0026rsquo;ve got a paper which I\u0026rsquo;d like to read, e.g. Variational Diffusion Models, I first have to manually download the paper into some location. By default, this results in a file named after the arXiv paper id, e.g. 2107.00630.pdf, which is annoying as the id is hard to associate with the actual paper title. Therefore, I usually rename the paper according to its title:\nmv 2107.00630.pdf ~/papers/generative-models/2107.00630v1.Variational_Diffusion_Models.pdf  Now the paper is ready to be automatically synced and I can find it on my tablet device. After repeating the above multiple times, I was especially annoyed by the file renaming necessity. Furthermore, it also happens that I often simply have the arXiv link and know that I want to have this paper on my tablet. I\u0026rsquo;m an avid Linux user and work from the terminal most of the time. Hence, it was natural to write a command-line tool that takes an arXiv link/id, downloads it into a preferred directory, and automatically renames the filename according to the title. This is when I came up with a simple tool called arxiv-downloader, wrapping the arXiv Python wrapper lukasschwab/arxiv.py.\nThis little tool is available on PyPi (pip install arxiv-downloader) and offers the arxiv-downloader script in the command-line:\n$ arxiv-downloader --url https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00630 --directory ~/papers/generative-models/ Directory /home/steven/papers/generative-models/ does not exist.

Result saved at: /home/steven/papers/generative-models/2107.00630v1.Variational_Diffusion_Models.pdf  This merges the sequence of opening an arXiv link, manually downloading the PDF, renaming this PDF according to the paper title, and moving the file to the final location, into a single command. Although this might only save me about half a minute for every paper, I deeply felt the need to automate these steps.

While substantial progress in the field of axis-aligned bounding-box detection has been made, it suffers from poor performance on oriented objects, resulting in large parts of the bounding box covering non-object related area. Therefore, the recent field of oriented object detection has emerged, generalizing object detection to arbitrary orientations which are commonly found in e.g. aerial view imagery or security camera footage. This enables a tighter fit of bounding boxes, leading to a better separation of bounding boxes especially in cases of dense object distributions. In this work we present DAFNe: a Dense one-stage Anchor-Free deep Network for oriented object detection. As one-stage model, DAFNe performs predictions on a dense grid over the input image, being architecturally simpler in design, as well as easier to optimize than their two-stage alternatives. Being an anchor-free model, DAFNe additionally reduces the prediction complexity by refraining from bounding box anchors which come with many burdens: anchor specifications need more attentive hyper-parameter fine-tuning on a per-dataset basis, increased model size and computational overhead. Moreover, we introduce a novel vectorized corner sorting algorithm to efficiently represent bounding boxes with a canonical corner ordering batch-wise, an orientation-aware center-ness formulation for arbitrary oriented bounding boxes to down-weight low-quality predictions, and a center-to-corner bounding-box prediction strategy that improves object localization performance. Our experiments show that DAFNe outperforms all previous one-stage anchor-free models on DOTA 1.0, to the best of our knowledge. DAFNe improves the prediction accuracy over the previous best results by 4.65% mAP, setting the new state-of-the-art results by achieving 76.95% mAP.\n","date":1620864e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1620864e3,"objectID":"4c5695742822dc2fb29d30d3392ae27f","permalink":"/project/master-thesis/","publishdate":"2021-05-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/master-thesis/","section":"project","summary":"Master Thesis at the AIML Lab TU Darmstadt","tags":["Deep Learning","Computer Vision","Oriented Object Detection","Object Detection"],"title":"Oriented Object Detection using a One-Stage Anchor-Free Deep Model","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Write-up and presentation during the Extended Machine Learning Seminar at TU Darmstadt about the Edward deep probabilistic programming language.\nAbstract Probabilistic programming is the approach to adopt probabilistic models and inference as first class citizens of a programming language.

Atrous convolutions have been successfully employed to this end in the task of semantic segmentation. In this paper we investigate, whether it is also possible to apply atrous convolutions in unsupervised monocular depth estimation. Specifically, we place an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling block in a convolutional neural network between the encoder and decoder. This block allows for computing feature maps at different spatial scales on top of the encoder output. Our experiments show that atrous convolutions in the proposed setup do not improve depth estimation performance. Furthermore, the necessity of a lower output stride after the encoder, such that an increased receptive field size is even applicable, harms runtime and increases memory consumption. Finally, we show that it is possible to reduce the number of channels after the encoder, which reduces the parameter count without impairing predictions.\nProject on Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation Using Atrous Convolutions in the Practical Course for Deep Learning in Computer Vision at TU Darmstadt.\n","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"3f4114cfa321c4a26fdfe2b39dedfb74","permalink":"/project/monodepth/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/monodepth/","section":"project","summary":"Practical Course for Deep Learning in Computer Vision at TU Darmstadt","tags":["Computer Vision","Deep Learning","Depth Estimation"],"title":"Unsupervised Monocular Depth Estimation using Atrous Convolutions","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Developed together with Peter Reutemann at the University of Waikato (New Zealand)\nAlgorithms Unsupervised:\n Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Generalized Least Squares Weighting (GLSW) External Parameter Orthogonalization (EPO) Independent Component Analysis (FastICA)  Supervised:\n Partial Least Squares (PLS1) Simple PLS (SIMPLS) Kernel PLS (KernelPLS) Orthogonal Signal Correction (OPLS) Nonlinear Iterative PLS (NIPALS) Sparse PLS (SparsePLS) Y Gradient based Generalized Least Squares Weighting (YGradientGLSW) Y Gradient based External Parameter Orthogonalization (YGradientEPO) Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) Domain Invariant PLS (DIPLS) Variance Constrained PLS Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC)  \u0026hellip;\n","date":1514851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514851200,"objectID":"6b5715473afe0385c14445c4e5be0d59","permalink":"/project/matrix-algorithms-java/","publishdate":"2018-01-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/matrix-algorithms-java/","section":"project","summary":"Java library of 2-dimensional matrix algorithms","tags":["Data Mining","Open Source Software","Java","Algorithms"],"title":"Java Matrix Algorithms Library","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Java library of multi-way algorithms.\nFor the documentation, go to: waikato-datamining.github.io/multiway-algorithms.\nDeveloped together with Peter Reutemann at the University of Waikato (New Zealand)\nImplemented Algorithms  Multi-linear PLS Non-Negative Tensor Factorization (NTF) PARAFAC Sequentially Orthogonalized Multilinear PLS (SONPLS) TwoWayPCA  ","date":1512604800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512604800,"objectID":"00b6f62e9dbc63601632768ab2cc7c15","permalink":"/project/multiwary-algorithms-java/","publishdate":"2017-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/multiwary-algorithms-java/","section":"project","summary":"Java library of multi-way algorithms","tags":["Java","Multi-way","Algorithms","Open Source Software"],"title":"Java Multi-Way Algorithms Library","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Bachelor Thesis at the JGU Mainz in the Research Group Data-Mining, supervised by Prof. Dr. Stefan Kramer and Dr. Joerg Wicker.\nAbstract Estimating degradation times of molecules, that possibly end up in the environment, is an important aspect for a wide range of industries.

This may be a Mustache or a smiling mouth. The procedure starts with taking k images of people with the feature and k images of people without the feature. These sets (positive/negative) are the input to an - on IMAGENET pretrained - VGG19 network. The output of each image is then fetched at the Relu layers of the third, fourth and fifth convolutional block. This builds a deep feature representation of an image. The deep feature vector of the target feature is then calculated by taking the difference of the mean of the positive and the negative set. To add the target feature to a new image, the target feature vector in the deep feature space will be added to the deep feature representation of this image.
