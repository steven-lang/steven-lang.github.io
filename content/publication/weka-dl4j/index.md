abstract: Deep learning is a branch of machine learning that generates multi-layered representations of data, commonly using artificial neural networks, and has improved the state-of-the-art in various machine learning tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, speech recognition, and document classification).  However, most popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch require users to write code to apply deep learning.  We present WekaDeeplearning4j,  a  Weka  package  that  makes  deep  learning  accessible through a graphical user interface (GUI). The package uses Deeplearning4j as  its  backend,  provides  GPU  support,  and  enables  GUI-based  training  of deep neural networks such as convolutional and recurrent neural networks. It also provides pre-processing functionality for image and text data.
